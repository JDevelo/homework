            <br>&quot;You know the rules and so do I&quot;
            <br>&quot;A full commitment's what I'm thinking of&quot;
            <br>&quot;You wouldn't get this from any other guy&quot;
            <br>&quot;I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling&quot;

            <br>&quot;Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it&quot;
            <br>&quot;Inside we both know what's been going on&quot;
            <br>&quot;We know the game and we're gonna play it&quot;
            <br>&quot;And if you ask me how I'm feeling&quot;
